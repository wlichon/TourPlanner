- Make it so the image gets requested based on the From and To properties

- Make it so the image mapquest call only gets made when either of them changes 
(has to be done through routeviewmodel, generalvm will have to notify routevm 
somehow as routevm wont know about change in selectedtour properties?)

- Check if OnPropertyChanged can be removed from subviewmodels

- Check if bytearray is jpeg
